% Letter Heading
\opening{Dear ASML,}

I am a Quantum Information Science graduate student at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA (GPA: 4.0), with a passion for quantum information and a strong background in computer science. I am an American citizen with a permanent residence permit in the Netherlands, can speak some Dutch, and have called Amsterdam home for more than 15 years.\\

I am completing my Master's degree this year, will be back in the Netherlands full-time in May 2025, and am considering my next steps. I reached out to a few employees at ASML, including Karwan Mohammed and Dimitrios Stogiannis, via Tjeerd Saxion at Hogeschool Saxion, with whom I participated in a quantum workshop last summer. They all recommended that I apply for a position at ASML.\\

I found the position "Physics | Engineering Internship: Particle Traps" particularly compelling, as it combines my recent studies with my background in computer science. The role sounds eerily similar to the work I did at IBM in Burlington, VT, USA, where I worked on defects in silicon wafers; however, those wafers were RAM chips.\\

I have extensive Python experience and have been using it alongside Haskell for my research, which focuses on categorical (category theory) programming language development for quantum simulation (Hamiltonian evolution, adiabatic quantum computing) of Ising models applied to NP-hard problems.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
